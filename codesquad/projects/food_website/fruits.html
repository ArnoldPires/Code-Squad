      <h1>Fruits</h1>
      <h3>What are fruits?</h3>
      <p>In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) formed from the ovary after flowering.</p>
      <p>Fruits are the means by which angiosperms disseminate seeds. Edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food. Accordingly, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.</p>
      <p>In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the fleshy seed-associated structures of a plant that are sweet or sour, and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, and strawberries. On the other hand, in botanical usage, "fruit" includes many structures that are not commonly called "fruits", such as bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains. The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body</p>

      <h3>History of Fruits</h3>
      <p>Archaeological evidence indicates human beings first began to grow their own food likely between 8000 and 9000 B.C. Much of that evidence was found in the Fertile Crescent, a region extending roughly from Israel and up the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea through Turkey and down into Iraq near the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. That was one of the most fertile areas of Mesopotamia during that time period and where early agriculture is believed to have begun. Vegetables, more specifically annuals including peas and grains, were likely the first food crops to be domesticated.
